This visual novel was made for Jheronimus Bosch 500, an event celebrating the 500th
anniversary of the artist’s death. It has a distinct “designy” visual style that refuses to
draw on the visual language of videogames. Hard lines and swaths of bright colours make up
the setting and characters, while elements of collage and frequent reference to Bosch’s work
give them game a surreal feeling. As it is primarily a visual novel, prepare yourself to
receive the game’s text, rather than taking on the role of this or that character.

We Are Müesli is an indie game design duo based in Milan, Italy, made up of visual designer
Claudia Molinari and creative writer Matteo Pozzi. Since 2013, We Are Müesli have been
focusing on narrative games rooted in cultural, historical and artistic topics.
