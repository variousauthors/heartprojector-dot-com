Rituals prepare us. When we pray, or read our horoscope, or meditate, we get
the sense of having set something straight. Afterwards we are more prepared to
receive what the world has for us today. There does not need to be a spiritual
component for rituals to work their magic; as Elwonger observes in Morning
Coffee, there is power in the mundane as well. When we chose rituals to be the
theme of this evening, we knew we wanted at least one offering to represent
the “daily ritual”. Morning Coffee does this to a T.
