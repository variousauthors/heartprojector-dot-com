Whether it be by reading the yarrow stalks, laying out tarot cards, or letting the
blood of vermin, we have always enacted rituals that give us insight into this
world and the next. Monkey Fortunetell offers to be this for us here and now. Sit
down, bring to mind a question or a problem, and cast the monkeys as instructed.
You wonâ€™t be disappointed.

Nathalie Lawhead (@alienmelon) is a collective construct of everyone's mind. She
only exits because everyone thinks she's real, so she spends all her time making
games. Rachel Simone Weil is an experimental designer whose work engages electronic
nostalgia, cute culture, and the history of computing and video games.
