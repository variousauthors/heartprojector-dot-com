Point your face at the computer and prepare to receive a collection of collage and noise.
Beautiful Ugly is coming apart at the seams, unravelling as you play it. You will return to
the same scenes again and again. With every step, the music and color intensify, the voices
and lights grow to a cacophony. It asks you to engage with it by virtue of being a game, but
keeps you at arm's length, never letting you get comfortable. This game is judging you,
there are not two ways about it.

Beautiful/Ugly is an exquisite corpse developed by Tafkaf, a group of digital artists and
game designers based in New York City. The project came out of their fascination with
computer glitch and a desire to explore the creative opportunities afforded by them.
