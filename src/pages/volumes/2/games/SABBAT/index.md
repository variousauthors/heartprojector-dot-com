Oh, little witchdumpling, you are not ready for this night. SABBAT is a fevered
prayer to a dark god, motivated by despair and anxiety. The game begins with a bloody
sacrifice, which sparks a transformation: our body splits and tears, but the wounds
of capitalism, patriarchy, and Christianity are sutured shut by this gameâ€™s wishful
and bloodthirsty daydream. Be warned, this work of alternative escapism is not for
the weak of heart, or the strong of faith.

eva problems is a queer trans woman who has authored several twines including this
one, SABBAT. can you believe she wrote it before she even figured out she was a girl?
weird, right? weird. come on.
