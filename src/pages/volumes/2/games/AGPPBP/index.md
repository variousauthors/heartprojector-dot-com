AGPPBP is a short ghost story about receiving text messages from
beyond the grave. Your lover has sent you an ebook; it’s one of
those scary stories you like. As you swipe through its pages,
their text messages begin to take on a sinister character:
someone is lying to you; strange things are happening elsewhere;
penis enlarging operations are available. The sense of urgency
and disorientation is complimented by the game’s plucky and
chaotic soundtrack.
