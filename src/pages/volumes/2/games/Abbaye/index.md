Certainly our most traditional offering. If you are of a certain age and from a certain
place, you may find yourself oddly compelled by Abbaye. Otherwise you are likely to find it
slow and frustrating. Its pace and challenge are meant to evoke a style of game design
popular in the 1980â€™s, when it was often not taken for granted that players would be able
to play through the entire game at all. Abbaye lacks a focused narrative, it is played for
the challenge rather than to find the ending.

Locomalito and Gryzor87 are two friends that share a common love for classic videogames.
They play with the limitations of the old platforms to create new games, always searching
for strong gameplay with simple controls and difficult challenges to beat.
