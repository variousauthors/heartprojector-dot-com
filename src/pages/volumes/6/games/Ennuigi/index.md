In Ennuigi you play as the shadow of a shadow: Luigi Mario wanders a broken mushroom kingdom in
the wake of a war that no one understands. His mind is swimming with regret and existential
dread, and with each pull on his cigarette we are treated to a snippet: a tiny peek into the
narrative void of Super Mario Bros.

Nintendoâ€™s Luigi will never age, reflect, or change, but not so the unlicensed Luigi of Josh
Millard. Luigi is freed to reflect on his own life, but through his release we too are invited
to reflect on the idols of our childhood. Something like that, any hey.
