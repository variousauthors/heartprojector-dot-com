Much as we’d like to believe the simple stories from our childhood videogames are just
that—colorful bits of nonsense thrown together, concerning ‘kingdoms’ and ‘castles’ and
‘princesses’—how can we help but spot the places where they don’t add up? In the real world,
for example, we know that ‘kingdoms’ do not sprout from the caps of toadstools: They are what
happens when one individual violently subjugates thousands of their peers (often for personal
gain). So if indeed the ‘Mushroom Kingdom’ is a kingdom, who is its monarch? What power did
they exert to capture the throne, and what was this power’s price? As players we have the right
to ask these questions; and of course, nothing can stop us from providing our own answers.
