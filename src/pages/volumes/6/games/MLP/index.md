Fighting is Magic started as a fan project to turn the My Little Pony IP into a three button
arcade fighter (think Street Fighter vs Capcom). After being issued a cease and desist order
from Hasbro, the project was rebranded as Themâ€™s Fighting Herds and is currently still in
development. Independently, a group of fans of the original project released Fighting Is Magic:
Tribute Edition, which is the game we present to you today.
