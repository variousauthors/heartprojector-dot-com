A dedicated community of fans has been working on this 3D version of Sonic the Hedgehog since
1998\. The project is a mod built on the DOOM engine and tries to faithfully reproduce the feel
of the original 2D Sonic games in shiny mid-80s 3D.

When we decided on No License as the theme for this evening, we knew we really wanted to bring
you a Sonic The Hedgehog fan-game. Sonic has spawned one of the internet’s most dedicated and
enthusiastic communities. The amount of fan-created lore and content out there is just
staggering. To get an idea of what we’re talking about, try googling “[YOUR NAME] The Hedgehog”.
Make sure to tweet about what you find!
