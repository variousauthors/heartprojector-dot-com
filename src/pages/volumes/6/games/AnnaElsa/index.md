There are literally hundreds of Disney-themed bootleg flash games. These days Frozen’s Anna and
Elsa seem to be the crowned queens of this pseudo-genre. There are literally scores of dress-up
games, hidden object, bejeweled and flappy-bird clones, surgery simulators... the list goes on!
All starring Elsa, or Anna, or even Olaf the lovable snow-golem!

Why does this exist? Probably because it brings in ad revenue. Regardless, it’s a fascinating
ecosystem. Check out juegosfrozen.com and let us know what you find!
