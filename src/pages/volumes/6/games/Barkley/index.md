When I think of the 90s videogame landscape, two things come to mind: endless hilariously sincere
translations of Japanese RPGs and Michael Jordan holding a flaming basketball. Clearly, Tales of
Game’s Studios is on the same page. Barkley, Shut Up and Jam: Gaiden is a perfect “what if?” that
mashes up licensed sports games with an unbelievably over-the-top JRPG storyline.

BSUaJG was released in 2008 by a small team. The game is built using RPGMaker 2003, an editor aimed
at letting anyone tell their own epic RPG story.
