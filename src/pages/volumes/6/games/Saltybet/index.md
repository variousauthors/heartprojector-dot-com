Salty Bet is a continuous live Twitch stream of AI fighters from the fandom multiverse. Each
fighter is lovingly crafted by a member of the Saltybet community, typically using unlicensed
IPs from various fandoms. Many versions of any one fighter exist, but those who win
consistently are considered the REALEST. It is the only place on the internet where you can
find Hatsune Miku battling Ryu, or Krang going head to head with Sailor Moon.
