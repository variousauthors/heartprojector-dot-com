Literally “Impaled Mario”, Mario Empalado is a violent hate letter from Brazilian anarchist
artist and game developer Pedro Paiva to “gamers” and consumer culture. The game has been
described as genuinely uncomfortable and has been derided as juvenile (primarily for its overt
use of violence and its jarring visual aesthetic). Taken in the broader context of Paiva’s
work, it is apparent that this cannot be the case.

In 2016 itch.io received a takedown notice from Nintendo of America demanding the removal of 50
videogames infringing on Nintendo’s intellectual property. Mario Empalado was among those games
and was therefore taken down; if you ask the right people, however, you might discover its
secret hiding place on the web...
