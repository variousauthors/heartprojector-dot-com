The Electronic Entertainment Expo “E3” may be the biggest gaming event of the year, and for
some attendance is the ultimate expression of their dedication to videogames. Depending on how
you feel about consumer culture, E3 may represent something else for you. For Heart Projector’s
own co-curator, critic, programmer and flayed limb scratching at chalk-board, Brendan Vance, E3
is a throbbing engorged nodule in the gut of videogames that has become conscious and threatens
to consume us all. You Died Alone at E3 2014 represents an attempt to encapsulate and describe
this strange organel.
