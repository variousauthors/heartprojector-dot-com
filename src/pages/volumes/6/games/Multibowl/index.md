Multibowl is a playable arcade grab-bag. Two players compete for points by playing a medley of
moments stolen from commercial videogames of the 80s and 90s. You might play 30 seconds of
Activision’s Fishing Derby, followed by a micro lap of Nintendo’s Super Mario Kart or
Excitebike! These are not remakes or covers: all of these 200+ games are included in their
entirety but we are treated to only the highlights of each.

In order to avoid any legal issues, the author has never publicly released Multibowl. It
remains one of the rare “private” videogames, playable only on special occasions by special
people.
