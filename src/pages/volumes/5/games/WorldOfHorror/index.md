World of Horror wears its primary influence, Junji Ito, like a badge of honour. Maybe it would
be more apt to say it wears Ito’s face as a mask. World of Horror is a terrifying little lo-fi
nightmare world filled to the brim with imaginative curses, monsters, ghouls, ghasts, and
eldritch horrors. There’s also a Shiba Inu shopkeeper, so that’s pretty cool. The game follows
one of eight possible player characters as they attempt to solve a card-drawn mystery. Can you
make it through the week before your sanity wears thin?

Panstasz (Paweł Koźmiński) is a dentistry student born in 1992 in Poland, and is the one man army behind the WORLD OF HORROR.
