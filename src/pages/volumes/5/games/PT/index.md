This is a very rare inclusion for Heart Projector: the playable teaser for an installation in
the Silent Hill franchise, a decidedly commercial enterprise. It is also, however, a remarkable
treasure. It was directed and designed by Hideo Kojima, in collaboration with film director
Guillermo Del Toro, both noted for their ability to sidestep the norms of their respective
industries. The game P.T. was meant to herald was later cancelled, and P.T. removed from the
playstation store. In fact, it is only by chance that we had a copy available to show you
tonight. Enjoy.
