Tonight You Die is a paranoid fantasy. You walk the streets of a city at night, everything you
see at once familiar and strange. Every street seems to lead back to the same plaza, dominated
by the silhouette of an indifferent public art installation. The darkness, the architecture,
and the game’s isolating soundtrack (as well as the note saying “tonight you die”) lend to the
game’s oppressive and suspenseful tone.

Jack Squires is an independent game creator from Los Angeles, California. His work focuses on
the use of horror and allegorical space to simulate existential dread and disassociation. Jack
worked closely with sound designer Taylor Shechet (EarwormAud.io) to emphasize the game's
themes of loneliness, control and anxiety through psychoacoustic techniques.
