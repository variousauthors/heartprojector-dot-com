Anatomy exemplifies the kind of horror that clings to you long after you’ve disengaged. It plays
on your fear that the mundane will come undone: that, in fact, someone IS standing behind the
shower curtain. Every time you look away from a mirror, there is a chance that when you look
back you won’t recognize what you see. Anatomy brings these kinds of fears to the front of your
mind, and then leaves them unresolved.

3D and first-person, tend to emphasize exploration, architecture, atmosphere, horror and the
uncanny, the occult, and spatial poetics.
