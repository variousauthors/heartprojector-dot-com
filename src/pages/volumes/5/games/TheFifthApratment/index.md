The 5th Apartment is a sad, lonely, and isolating experience. In it we are given a window into
a woman’s declining health, and into her deepest regrets. The game takes place in the woman’s
apartment in the 5th arrondissement of Paris, a setting influenced by Roman Polanski’s “The
Tenant”. At night we can hear whispers through the walls, and her own devils are made manifest.

Bruno Poli, Klos Cunha and their friends have been making games (or game-like things) since
2012\. Their tiny studio is located in Brazil, but they don’t like summer nor samba. They don't
have 100% defined roles, but Bruno is responsible for code, papers and sounds, and Klos for
design, art and stories.
