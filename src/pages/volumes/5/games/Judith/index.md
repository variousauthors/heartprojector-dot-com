Judith is a short, haunting narrative inspired by the folk story “Bluebeard’s Wives”. The
narrative is split between present and past. In the present the player is Jeff, searching for
his lover Anne, who has vanished into an old castle; in the past the player is Judith,
Bluebeard’s latest wife, naively exploring her husband’s many secrets. The sound design and
visuals are jarring and lo-rez, with the somewhat dizzying hard edges of the environments
lending to the sense of being lost and alone.

Terry Cavanagh is an Irish independent game designer interested in minimal, concept driven
games; his best known works are VVVVVV and Super Hexagon. Stephen Lavelle creates computer
games and tools under the alias Increpare; he recently completed work on a puzzle game called
Stephen's Sausage Roll.
