“My Uncle told me... he works for Nintendo.” Once, long ago, you might have heard a schoolyard rival
make this boast during recess. It might have infuriated you to know that your friend held such
wondrous insider knowledge; eventually, however, you would surely have discovered it all to be a
lie. If this school chum had no Uncle—or at least, not one who worked for Nintendo—why then would
they tell such an obvious falsehood? Why talk so insistently about this non-existent man in
possession of so many secrets? Perhaps tonight’s selection will put your curiosity to rest.
