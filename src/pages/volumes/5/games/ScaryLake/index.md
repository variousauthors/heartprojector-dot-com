Mirror Lake is a world in a tiny stone bowl. Black spires and blades of grass push their way up
from the dirt. It is a calming game, completely free of jump scares. Tonight, however, Mirror
Lake has teamed up with Jump Scares For Your Desktop, and we believe that you will find the
result... astonishing!?

@alienmelon (also know as Nathalie Lawhead in some human circles) is a thumb-sized brain alien
inhabiting a human-sized fleshy robot suit. She spends most of her time on Earth making video
games for the human internet, and one day plans to return to her people in order to share her
knowledge of the human race and their computer entertainment.

Katie Rose Pipkin is a drawing and language artist from the woods outside of Austin, Texas. They
produce printed material as books, chapbooks, and zines, as well as digital work in software,
bots, and games. They also make drawings by hand, on paper.
