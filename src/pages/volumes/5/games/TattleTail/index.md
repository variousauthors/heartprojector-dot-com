Tattletail takes place over several nights leading up to Christmas. Each night the player, a
naughty child, sneaks into the basement to play with their present: a mischievous talking doll.
Each night the game peels back another layer of reality, and play slips from the uncanniness of
the familiar into the tense carnival of survival horror.

Ben Esposito is an independent game maker and online trickster based in Los Angeles. Tattletail
was developed with Geneva Hodgson (cartoonist, character designer) and Thomas Astle, another
indie developer working on the upcoming Wobbledogs.
