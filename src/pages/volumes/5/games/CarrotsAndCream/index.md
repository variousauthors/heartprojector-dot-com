Carrots and Cream is a study in making the macabre out of the mundane. Let the camera linger
long enough on a carrot as it is dragged back and forth (back and forth) across the grater and,
sure as worms from loamy soil, the uncanny emerges.

Aergia is an ongoing side project for Copenhagen based developer Kristian W.-Torgard. Mostly
experimenting with game mechanics and the weirder moods and emotions that video games can
conjure.
