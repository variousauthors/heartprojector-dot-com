You land as a stranger, picking up trash and making the things grow. Climb to the top
of the cloud and learn how to transpose the nature of space/self.

Remember to deposit your cans at the nearest recycling depot.

Paloma Dawkins is an animation artist that exploits video games as a medium to create
her fantastical landscapes and characters. Her projects hardly ever provide the player
with a clear goal or ending, neither a sense of self in the game, but instead you are
provided a momentum for exploration. The message is a meditation on life and nature as
a trip meant to be enjoyed and not measured by skill, time spent, level reached or
items collected.
