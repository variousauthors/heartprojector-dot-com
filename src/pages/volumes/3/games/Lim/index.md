“Lim is a game about violence. About the violence of standing out, and even more about the
violence of blending in.” - Games for Change

Players navigate a labyrinth as a multi-colored square with the ability to (with some
discomfort and effort) match their colour to those around them. Blending in becomes
essential to traversing the space and in fact to your own survival.
