This game is a digital examination of Gregor Schneider's iconic work "Totes Haus u r", and
specifically the sparse cell inside it known as "u r 1". Schneider's work involved the almost
endless renovation, re-renovation and re-invention of the interior of a house in Germany. The
house contains rooms that rotate, rooms that are completely insulated, walls behind walls, and
much more.

v r 1 is a recreation of an artwork that has been recreated over and over within itself as well
as in different physical locations. “I was most interested in seeing how creating doubled
spaces differs in a virtual setting” - Pippin Barr
