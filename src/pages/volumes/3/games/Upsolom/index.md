Enter your mechsuit and deploy. Drift silently onward, patrolling the rooftops of a
perfectly orderly city in search of signs.

“We love cryptic aesthetics and vast landscapes. Upsolom is a little experiment with...
Brutalist Architecture and a world that doesn’t care about you.” - Granada

GranaDa are “just two guys from Brazil.”
