This space is hung on a logic completely alien to our physical existence, proudly
foregrounding its digital materiality and origin. The ‘walls’ formed by vertical
bands of colour forever fold away for you. There you are, inside an idea, and then
you push against the membrane of the moment, and like any good dreamscape, it
constantly yields, again parting itself as a curtain would.

Titouan Millet is a French multimedia artist from the Klondike collective. He loves
to play with shapes, colours and motion. Most of his projects are experimental,
abstract, colourful.
