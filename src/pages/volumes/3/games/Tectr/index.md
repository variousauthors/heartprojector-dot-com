Tectr, the dating app for real estates, is a game about thirsty architecture where
buildings want you inside them. Find your matches, see if you're compatible, and hook
up with some feisty real estate.

(When Heart Projector selected Claris to be our guest curator for this event, we told
her we had only enough machines to show 12 videogames. We cleverly neglected to mention
the 13th computer, on which we now present Tectr as our ‘house pick’.)
