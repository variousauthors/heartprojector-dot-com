Cyborg, you are tasked with hacking nodes and traversing the vertiginous
skyline of NeoQusqo. You have been equipped with augmented legs, a jetpack,
and a stealth suit. Thanks to “diversionary acts of cyber-terrorism” you will
not encounter anyone else.

Connor Sherlock is making videogame spaces to get lonely and lost in. His
games focus on the permeability of level boundaries and the futility of total
player agency in a world that will ignore them.
