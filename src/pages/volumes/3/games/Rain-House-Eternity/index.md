Ascend an ancient structure and gather your thoughts, strewn about each level like so
many purple crystals. You were brought to this altar. Soon, you will make a choice. In
this sacred, solitary space, built for our unique oppression, we are free to imagine
change.

Kitty Horrorshow is an independent game developer crow-goddess witchqueen. Her games,
most often 3D and first-person, tend to emphasize exploration, architecture,
atmosphere, horror and the uncanny, the occult, and spatial poetics.
