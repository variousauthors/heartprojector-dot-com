Trigger Warning: Emotional Abuse

CURTAIN is an interactive first-person narrative about Kaci & Ally, two women in a Glasgow punk
band. Through an impressionistic art style players embody Ally to explore the physical spaces
of their relationship, and how it evolves in time. From the detritus, players find they can
piece together the story while Kaci, your partner and inescapable narrator, watches and
comments on every thought and action.

DREAMFEEL writes strange, intense and wonderful games from the remote reaches of Ireland. Games
like Fluc, The Isle is Full of Noises & SPACE BLOOD. Currently she's writing a big one called
SZeance, about three kids who discover a frightening board game. And she loves u, cos u deserve
good. <3
