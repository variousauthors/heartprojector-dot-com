Joy Exhbition is a game about learning to communicate with a mute alien
race using only shape, texture, and colour. Take part in a world of
motion, contemplation, and an endless supply of procedurally generated
paint guns. What will you create?

Strangethink is a maker of works that are an exercise in ambiance,
mysterious systems and found beauty. They are exploritory games that ask
the player to participate with the world, rather than be acted upon by
it. More games by Strangethink can be found at
