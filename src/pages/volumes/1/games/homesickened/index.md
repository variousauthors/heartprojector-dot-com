You can't go home again. Except that you can. But you don't
really want to. And then you do, anyway.

Snapman is a chicagoland-based hobbyist game dev with an
interest in melancholic technostalgia. His previous work
includes the unfinished Fred's Exciting Adventure trilogy (a
puzzle horror series), and Scorpion Psychiatrists of Saturn (a
sendup/mashup of 2011's indie scene). He is currently working on
a VR adventure game set in an alternate history version of the
90s' world-wide-web.
