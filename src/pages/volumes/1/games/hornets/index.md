Rhiannon Blackwood, better known as Kitty Horrorshow, is an independent game developer crow-goddess witchqueen. Her games, most often 3D and first-person, tend to emphasize exploration, architecture, atmosphere, horror and the uncanny, the occult, and the use of space for narrative and poetry. She'd love you to follow her on twitter, @kittyhorrorshow.

"Hornets" was created in April of 2015 for the 48 hour Ludum Dare 32
competition, the theme of which was 'An Unconventional Weapon.'  Ms.
Blackwood is very proud of it because the hornets are very very big, and
it's hard to find hornets that are so big.
