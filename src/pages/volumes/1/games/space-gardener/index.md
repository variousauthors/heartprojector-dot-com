Space Gardener is a relaxing little experience about tending a garden on a rock
in space. It's meant to be calming and peaceful to help you decompress a bit. I
usually recommend playing it with sound on and with a cup of tea and maybe a nice
biscuit. It was made as a school project in about 5 weeks. Random fact: every
sound effect in the game is a sample from a musical instrument.

Like, a hundred bears (real name Carter Crown) is an indie game developer in
Vancouver. After wanting to makes games since kindergarten, he graduated from the
Art Institute in 2015 and has since started teaching game development to teens.
He's made 3 public games to date, of which Space Gardener is one. You can usually
find him at the Full Indie meetup each month or on twitter @like100bears.
