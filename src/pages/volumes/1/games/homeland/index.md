Homeland is a short, narrative game created over a few days, and inspired by
the work of Kitty Horrorshow. It is a dream-like piece replete with
beautiful caves, ominous architecture, letters between old friends, and
mystic markings.

Rook is an independent game maker and musician operating out of coastal
British Columbia, Canada. She creates wonderfully surrealist,
exploration-oriented games about escapism, gender, and anxiety. Currently,
Rook is in the process of creating a “gothic americana” adventure game
entitled Fallow (a demo of which is available at Rook’s itch.io page).
