Volume 4 invited guest curator Robert Yang to guide us through a selection of works that encouraged us to wander and drift through them. These are games that invite us to reflect on and blur the lines between the functional and the useless. Rather than focusing on “winning”, “solving” or “beating” these games, we discover new meanings of play through them.

"When freedom is practiced in a closed circle, it fades into a dream, becomes a mere image of itself. The ambiance of play is by nature unstable. At any moment, 'ordinary life' may prevail once again. The geographical limitation of play is even more striking than its temporal limitation. Every game takes place within the boundaries of its own spatial domain."
-- Guy Debord, 1959
