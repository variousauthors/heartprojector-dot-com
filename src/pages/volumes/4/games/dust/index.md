The most famous map of the deeply influential game Counter-Strike. It represents a Western fantasy of the Middle East; a bright clean sandstone ruin that lets players clearly distinguish friend from foe. Will the "War on Terror" destroy the Arab world? This place seems to argue: “Only if the ‘terrorists’ win.”

We have disabled the gameplay on this version of the map so that you can enjoy this place as a civilian.
