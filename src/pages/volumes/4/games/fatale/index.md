Fatale is an experimental tableau that takes place in the aftermath of the Oscar Wilde play Salome. You wake in the prison cistern and watch with growing dread as Salome dances just out of reach. What it will mean for you when the dance finally ends and you are set free?

The second scene, The Terrace, aks for a different sort of contemplation. As you flit from candle to candle, you leave only darkness in your wake. What do these lights represent? Tale of Tales offers no answers, but instead invites you to experiment and form your own interpretation.

Auriea Harvey and MichaÃ«l Samyn have released 8 videogames over the years including The Path, Luxuria Superbia and Sunset: all controversial and innovative and pushing what games can be. They recently switched focus to more artistic exploration in Cathedral-in-the-Clouds.
