Slave of God captures the feeling of getting way too drunk and high and going to a club by analogy with audio/visual overload. Everything is too loud and too bright, and you keep bumping into things and making a fool of yourself, but when you’re painfully stoned there is no recourse. You must work harder if you want to have fun.

Slave of God is somewhat unique among the games at tonight’s arcade, in that it subverts the ‘first person shooter’ genre’s traditional obsession with realism by vomiting bright sounds all over a concrete setting, rather than presenting a stark and abstract setting made of concrete materials (often concrete).

Stephen Lavelle creates computer games and tools under the alias Increpare. He recently completed work on a puzzle game called Stephen's Sausage Roll.
