Feign plays with our expectations as we sit down at the game. We’ve learned to read videogames in just such a way, but this one challenges us to give these unwritten rules another look. This spirit runs through every contemporary FIRST PERSON SHOOTER game, as well as its cousin the WALKING SIMULATOR; authors like Davey Wreden (The Beginner’s Guide), The Chinese Room (Dear Esther) and Snyder himself have all experimented with different ways to compose games that make use of unreliable perspectives.

Fossil records show that the animal, colloquially known as the Ian Snyder lived in what is now the Pacific Northwestern United States from a period of 1,000,000 BC through 250,000 BC. The ultimate cause of this strange beast's extinction continues to elude scientists, but should you ask local residents of the area they will tell you the creature still exists - wandering the deep, pre-historic forests of Washington even today.
