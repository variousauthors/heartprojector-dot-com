The Captain plays like a never-before-seen bad ending to your favourite episode of Star Trek. You’ve led your crew into danger, but this time everything went wrong. The magical ‘fix it’ buttons don’t work anymore; you’ve no phase inverters left to induce, nor any phase inducers left to invert. Your crew members eye you with rage and desperation. How could you let this happen? Why are you always failing the people you care about? What are you going to do now?
