When the members of consumer society declare a product to be ‘the first of its kind’, we don’t mean it actually INVENTED something; we mean it was the first to be imitated en masse by an army of competitors. Such was the case in 1992, when a company called id Software released the nazi-slaying, pistol-popping Wolfenstein 3D (progenitor of the FIRST PERSON SHOOTER genre from which every game at tonight’s arcade descends).

While the industry raced to provide ever-more-photorealistic nazis for players to shoot, the art scene sought to provide just about anything else. Here the artists have hacked Wolf3D’s code to turn the game into something unrecognizable: a stark new reality in which all nazis are floating triangles and all walls are modern art.

Jodi, or ‘jodi.org’, is a collective of two internet artists: Joan Heemskerk and Dirk Paesmans.
