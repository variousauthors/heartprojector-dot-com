A game about memories as they age, ferment and in time begin to sour. A doomed attempt to unbreak broken. A bridge built hastily between the worlds of the living and the dead. A love story played out in bathrooms and forests; in art galleries and counselling rooms; in hospital beds, and through a pane of glass.

Robert Yang is an indie game developer, academic, writer AND tonight’s guest curator. He regularly teaches game development and design within NYU Game Center at New York University, IDM at NYU Poly School of Engineering, and MFADT at Parsons the New School for Design.He also occasionally writes about games for Rock Paper Shotgun and other British things.

(Radiator 1 is Heart Projector’s house pick for this evening.)
