Around the year 2000, advances in computer graphics made it possible for videogames to use the very same special camera effects that movies do: motion blur, depth of field, film grain and even lens flare. People had different ideas about what to do with this. Game studio megastars like Cliff ‘Gears of War’ Bleszinski imagined cinematic tragedies, about cinematic men with cinematic guns making cinematic choices about who to shoot with their guns.

This artist envisioned tragedy of more modest sort: a game where you can’t find your glasses so everything is really blurry. We find it kind of funny; we find it kind of sad.
